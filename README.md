This project demonstrates how to combine React (including the latest features such as hooks and context) and p5.js:

    Multiple p5 sketches on a same screen;
    Multiple instances of one sketch mounted in a same component;
    Mount sketches in different points of the DOM tree;
    p5.js libraries support
    Bidirectional communication between the main React app and sketches;
    Using the latest React features:
    Styled-Components

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
